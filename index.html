<h1>Privacy Policy for Armaga Antivirus</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how Armaga Antivirus ("the App," "we," "us," or "our")
collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our mobile
application for Android devices. The App is developed and operated by
Individual Entrepreneur Barkov Nikita Sergeevich (ИП Барков Никита Сергеевич).
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.
By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the practices described
in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide the App's functionality,
improve its performance, and ensure user safety. Data collection is primarily
local to your device, with limited transmission to third-party services for
specific purposes. We categorize the collected information as follows:
</p>

<h3>1.1 Device and App Data (Collected Locally)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>List of Installed Applications:</strong> To scan for potential threats and provide app management features.</li>
    <li><strong>File Information on the Device:</strong> Limited to metadata (e.g., file names, sizes, and types) during scans; we do not access or collect the contents of your personal files.</li>
    <li><strong>Scan History:</strong> Records of scans performed, including dates, results, and detected threats.</li>
    <li><strong>Detected Threats:</strong> Details about identified malware or suspicious items, stored for quarantine and reference.</li>
    <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> User preferences, such as real-time protection status, auto-scan schedules, notification settings, language choices (English or Russian), and theme options (e.g., dynamic colors via Material You).</li>
    <li><strong>Device Model and Android Version:</strong> Anonymized for compatibility checks and analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is stored securely on your device and is not transmitted to our servers
unless explicitly required for synchronization (see Section 1.2).
</p>

<h3>1.2 User Account Data (Optional, via Google Authentication)</h3>
<p>
If you choose to sign in with Google for features like settings synchronization
and personalization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address</strong></li>
    <li><strong>User Name</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Profile Photo</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Google ID</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
This data is collected only with your explicit consent during the sign-in process
and is used solely for the purposes described in Section 2. We do not collect or
store passwords or other sensitive authentication details.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Analytics and Crash Reports</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Error Logs and Crash Data:</strong> Via Firebase Crashlytics, including app errors, device model, Android version, and non-personal identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> Anonymized data on app interactions (e.g., frequency of scans) to improve stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not link this data to individual users unless necessary for debugging.
</p>

<h3>1.4 Advertising Data (In Free Version)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID (AD_ID):</strong> Used by Google AdMob to deliver personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Interaction Data:</strong> Information about ad views and clicks, anonymized where possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This applies only to the free version of the App; the Premium version is ad-free.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
<p>We explicitly do not collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal files or their contents.</li>
    <li>Contacts, SMS messages, or call logs.</li>
    <li>Geolocation data.</li>
    <li>Passwords, banking information, or other financial details.</li>
    <li>Network traffic content (though we monitor for suspicious activity patterns).</li>
    <li>Any data from children under 13 years of age (the App is not intended for children).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies outside of the integrated
third-party services.
</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Providing Core Functionality: Scanning devices for threats using signature-based, heuristic, AI-driven, and Google Play Protect integration; real-time monitoring; quarantine management; and app permission reviews.</li>
    <li>Personalization and Synchronization: If you sign in with Google, we use your account data to sync settings across devices and provide tailored AI-assistant responses.</li>
    <li>Improving the App: Analyzing crash reports and anonymized usage data to fix bugs, enhance stability, and develop new features.</li>
    <li>Security and Threat Detection: Processing device and file metadata to identify and isolate malware, with automatic daily scans and virus signature updates.</li>
    <li>Notifications and Alerts: Sending push notifications for threat detections, scan completions, updates, and protection status (with your permission).</li>
    <li>Advertising: In the free version, using Advertising ID to show relevant ads via AdMob; we do not share personal data with advertisers.</li>
    <li>Compliance and Legal Purposes: To comply with applicable laws, respond to legal requests, or protect our rights and users' safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not use your data for marketing purposes beyond in-app ads, and we do not sell,
rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing.
</p>

<h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>

<h3>3.1 Third-Party Services</h3>

    <li>Google AdMob: For advertising in the free version. Google’s Privacy Policy applies.</li>
    <li>Google Play Protect: For enhanced threat detection; data shared is limited to app scans and follows Google’s policies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Other Disclosures</h3>

</ul>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

<h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>

    <li>We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined, or until you request deletion.</li>

</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Encryption: Local data is encrypted using device-level security features.</li>
    <li>Secure Authentication: Via Google Credential Manager.</li>
    <li>Isolated Quarantine: Threats are stored in a secure, inaccessible folder.</li>
    <li>Regular Updates: Virus signatures are updated daily over secure connections.</li>
    <li>Code Obfuscation: ProGuard is used in release builds to protect against reverse engineering.</li>
    <li>Access Controls: Permissions are requested only when necessary (see Section 6).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite these measures, no system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute
protection against unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2>6. Permissions and Access</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mandatory: INTERNET, storage access, app querying, notifications, foreground services.</li>
    <li>Optional: Accessibility, system alerts, VPN binding for network monitoring.</li>

<p>
We request permissions transparently and use them only for stated purposes.
